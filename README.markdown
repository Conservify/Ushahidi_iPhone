# Ushahidi iPhone

Ushahidi is an open source platform for democratizing information, increasing transparency and lowering the barriers for individuals to share their stories. 

The iPhone and iPad app synchronizes with any Ushahidi deployment allowing viewing and creation of incident reports on the go. 

The app supports loading of multiple deployments at one time, quick filtering through incident reports, exploring incident locations on the map, viewing incident photos, news article, media as well as sharing incident reports via email, SMS or Twitter. Once the data has been downloaded, the app can function without an internet connection, allowing accurate collection of data utilizing the device's camera and GPS capabilities.
